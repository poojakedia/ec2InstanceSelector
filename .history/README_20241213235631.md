## Ideation

After having worked on a project while employing an EC2 Instance, I realized it may not be intuitive to choose an EC2 instance for a specific project requirements. 

AWS has a very wide range of EC2 Instance types that are optimized for different constraints. Primarily, various computational strengths, memory variances, and storage preferences. In fact, this dataset highlights over 800 EC2 instances to choose. Hence, this is a easy to use tool to filter various EC2 Instance choices. 

## Implementation

This app was created using `Pynecone` for the lightweight and interactive UI design and `sqlite` for efficiently querying the ec2 instance results.

The dataset was sourced from the follow [EC2 Instance Dataset](https://instances.vantage.sh/).
